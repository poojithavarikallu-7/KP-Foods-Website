# KP-Foods-Website-eCommerce-Project

Welcome to the KP Foods website repository! This project is a responsive and visually engaging website designed for KP Foods, an authentic Indian cuisine restaurant specializing in rich, traditional dishes with bold flavors.

## About the Project

KP Foods is more than just a restaurant — it’s a celebration of Indian culinary heritage. This website showcases their diverse menu, ranging from flavorful biryanis to handcrafted starters and desserts. The goal was to create an inviting online presence that captures the essence of KP Foods and makes it easy for visitors to explore the menu and get in touch.
