                <h1 style="color: darkorange;">About Us</h1>
                <div class="pre"><pre>At <span style="color: orange;"><b>"KP Foods"</b></span>,we believe food is more than just sustenance — it's a connection to culture, family, 
and memory. Founded with a passion for authentic Indian cuisine, our mission is simple: to serve
bold, flavorful dishes made with love and integrity.

We specialize in biryanis from across India — from the rich Nawabi flavors of Lucknow to the 
fiery zest of Sindh, and the slow-cooked magic of Hyderabadi dum biryani. But we don’t stop 
there. Our menu features hand-crafted starters, indulgent desserts, and timeless recipes that 
bring people together at every table. 

Every ingredient is handpicked. Every spice is blended in-house. And every dish is cooked 
fresh — just like home.

Whether you're grabbing a quick bite, hosting a party, or simply craving something special, 
KP Foods is here to deliver a feast for the senses.
